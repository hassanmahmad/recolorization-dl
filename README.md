# recolorization-dl
Developed a deep learning model to add colors to grayscale images using the Oxford Flowers dataset. The project involved preprocessing images, designing a data generator, and implementing a baseline model for recolorization.

### Key Contributions:

Preprocessed the Oxford Flowers dataset and created a grayscale-to-color mapping pipeline.
Designed a custom data generator to handle grayscale images and their corresponding color palettes.
Implemented a baseline model to recolor grayscale images based on mean RGB intensities.
Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and a custom metric to compare generated images with the baseline.

### Results:

Achieved a baseline MSE of [insert value here] on the test set.
Designed a framework for further improvement over the baseline model.
